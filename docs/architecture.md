Architecture Documentation:

2. Technology Stack
Frontend Framework: Next.js (latest version with App Router)
Styling: Tailwind CSS (latest version)
Component Library: ShadcnUI
Package Manager: Bun

3. Core Components
Pages and Routing: The application leverages Next.js's App Router to manage dynamic and static routes effectively, ensuring a seamless navigation experience throughout the app.

Components: Custom and pre-designed components are implemented using ShadcnUI, providing a consistent design language and interaction pattern across the application.

4. Styling
Tailwind CSS: Utilized for a utility-first styling approach, allowing for responsive and neat design implementations directly within component templates. Custom themes or global styles may be defined using Tailwind configuration to meet specific design needs.

5. Linting and Formatting
ESLint: Configured for maintaining code quality and consistency. Extensions and plugins used include standard Next.js and React lint rules, along with Tailwind CSS plugin for linting style configurations.

Prettier: Integrated alongside ESLint to handle code formatting, ensuring a uniform codebase that's readable and maintainable.

6. Testing Framework
Vitest: Utilized for its fast and efficient testing capabilities tailored for modern JavaScript applications. Vitest offers a smooth testing experience aligning well with our tech stack.

React Testing Library: Used in conjunction with Vitest to facilitate a user-centric approach to testing React components, focusing on testing components from the end-user's perspective.

7. Package and Build Management
Bun: Employed for its high performance package management and its capability as an efficient task runner. Bun enhances build and dependency management processes, offering a significant performance boost over traditional Node.js setups.

8. Deployment and Hosting
Platform: Typically deployed on platforms like Vercel, known for optimal hosting support for Next.js applications and easy integration with Git-based workflows for automated deployments.

9. Security and Compliance
Secure environment variable management is conducted using Next.js's environment configuration options to protect sensitive information. [Additional security strategies, if any, can be added here.]
